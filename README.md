## About Me

Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Raymond DeVries, and I am a software engineer at Washington State University. I have degrees in computer science and neuroscience. 

### Contact 

To contact me about possible career opportunities, something you want to collaborate on, your latest mountain adventure, or just to say hi email me at [contact@raymond-devries.com](mailto:contact@raymond-devries.com).

## Here are few interesting things I enjoy:

### Python
Python is an incredible, flexible, and accessible language. If you want to do something, chances are you can do it in Python. While I am proficient in other languages my expertise and my tool of choice is python.

### Web Development

Building websites is how I got introduced to coding. They are great starting point when learning to code. I have extensive experience with Django and I have used other web frameworks such as Flask and FastAPI. I have built multiple websites as the Webmaster of the Skagit Alpine Club including our course registration site which processed over $10,000 worth of payments. All my code for websites that I build for the Skagit Alpine Club are open source and can be found on my GitHub. The source code for the course registration site can be found [here](https://github.com/raymond-devries/skagit-bmc-registration).

### GIS and Maps

As avid outdoorsman maps never fail to get me stoked! Extracting and processing raster and vector data to create custom maps that fit specific needs is one of my favorite activities. I created a docker based tool that takes in data from Open Street Maps and turns it into POSTGIS databases for use on your local machine. This tool was designed with non-technical folks in mind to make mapping data more accessible and easier to get started with. That project can be found [here](https://github.com/raymond-devries/osm-postgis-manager). My next mapping project is a tool that will automate the process of creating clean contours from lidar data using QGIS.

### Data Analysis

I enjoy data processing pipelines, and making data work for you. I am proficient with Pandas, Numpy, and Numba. I have explored multiprocessing/multi-machine data processing with Dask. To see a data processing project I did as part of my internship with the Department of Defense checkout [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/raymond-devries/jet-scraping/blob/master/explore.ipynb) that takes raw data I scraped from wikipedia and turns it into an organized table of fighter jet data.

### Getting Outside

After a productive day coding you'll find me trail running, climbing, mountain biking, or getting out for paddle! On the weekends or my time off you'll find me chasing summits, long alpine routes, or backcountry skiing. Getting outside is an integral part of my life.
